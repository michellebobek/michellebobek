## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Michelle Bobek, a first-year Ph.D. student and research associate in computational social science, at the Chair for Data Science and Digitization at Justus-Liebig-University Giessen. 

My main research interests include:
- Social Media Analytics
- Causal Inference
- Natural Language Processing

In my projects, I evaluate how the *wisdom of crowds* can help combat misinformation on social media platforms. Specifically, I examine the impact of community-based fact-checking interventions on user engagement with misinformation, using causal inference methods.
